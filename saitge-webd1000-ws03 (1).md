# Guided Workshop: Planning Your Website – Content Inventory & Sitemap

## Why This Matters

Before writing any code, you need a plan. A website is like a building:

* The **content inventory** is your list of materials.
* The **sitemap** is your blueprint for how everything fits together.

This exercise will guide you through creating both.

## Step 1: Define Your Website Idea

**Task:** Choose a website idea that matters to you. Examples:

* A **portfolio site** to showcase your projects
* A **club or community site** for events and updates
* A **small business site** for services or products

👉 Write your idea below (2–3 sentences):

* What is the purpose of your site?
* Who is your main audience?
* What should visitors be able to do?

**My Website Idea:**

```
The purpose of my site is to promote and organize the upcoming FC25 Gaming Competition. 
My main audience is competitive FC25 players and fans who want to register, follow match schedules, and check results. 
Visitors should be able to register for the tournament, view live updates, check the leaderboard, and get event details.

## Step 2: Create a Content Inventory

Your content inventory is a list of everything your site will include.

### How to do it:

1. **List your pages**: Start with *Home, About, Contact*. Add more as needed (e.g., Projects, Blog, Services).
2. **Add content items** under each page: text, images, forms, videos, etc.
3. **Mark priority**: High = must have, Medium = nice to have, Low = optional.

### Example (Portfolio Site):

| Page/Section | Content Item          | Type  | Source           | Priority | Notes               |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| Homepage     | Welcome message       | Text  | Write myself     | High     | Keep to 2 sentences |
| Homepage     | Headshot photo        | Image | Personal photo   | High     | Crop and resize     |
| About        | Short bio             | Text  | Write myself     | High     | Use plain language  |
| Projects     | Screenshot of project | Image | From GitHub repo | High     | Must be compressed  |

### Now You Try:

Fill in your own **Content Inventory Table** below.
| Page/Section | Content Item                | Type       | Source        | Priority | Notes                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| Homepage     | Big event banner + intro    | Text/Image | Made by me    | High     | Make it fun and easy to read |
| About        | Rules of the game + prizes  | Text/Image | Organizer     | High     | Explain clearly              |
| Schedule     | Match schedule              | Text       | Organizer     | High     | Show when games happen       |
| Leaderboard  | Player scores               | Text       | Match results | High     | Update after each game       |
| Contact      | Sign-up form + social links | Form/Text  | Me / Social   | High     | Easy for players to join     |
*(Add more rows as needed.)*


## Step 3: Draw Your Sitemap

A sitemap shows how your pages connect.

### Rules of Thumb:

* Keep **5–7 items** in your top navigation.
* Group related pages (e.g., “About → Team”).
* Labels should be **clear and consistent** (don’t mix “About Me” and “Who I Am”).

### Example (Portfolio Site):

```
Home
 ├── About
 ├── Projects
 │     ├── Project 1
 │     ├── Project 2
 ├── Blog
 └── Contact
```

### Your Turn:

👉 Use **boxes for pages** and **arrows for links**.
Options:

* Draw on paper and take a photo.
* Use a free tool: draw\.io, Lucidchart, or Miro.

**Sketch Space:**
[ Home ]
   ├── [ About ]
   │       └── [ Rules & Prizes ]
   ├── [ Schedule ]
   ├── [ Leaderboard ]
   └── [ Contact ]
           └── [ Sign-up Form / Social Links ]


## Step 4: Reflect

Answer these reflection prompts in 3–4 sentences:

1. How did your target audience shape your sitemap?
2. Was any part of your site hard to organize? Why?
3. How will you make sure your site structure supports accessibility?

**My Reflection:**
